<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'><big>Pakistan=The day begins with prayers for men in the mosques, often in large open grounds, so that a maximum number of worshippers can attend the prayers together. After meeting one another, once the prayers are over, people head home and visit relatives and friends with their loved ones.

The first day is usually dedicated to close family relatives, with the elders giving Eidi—a monetary gift—to young ones in the family. Family feasts are an important part of the Eid where, if not all, the majority of family members gather to enjoy the celebrations together.

People greet each other with “Eid Mubarak,” which is usually followed by an embrace. It is also customary in many homes to greet elder relatives by kissing their right hand as a sign of respect. In return, elders will often bless the children with a quick prayer. Sheer Khurma, a vermicelli pudding, and Biryani, a spicy rice dish, are usually prepared in Pakistani homes. The festival of Eid is a three-day holiday in the country.

The streets are often full of people on the days of Eid, with outdoor rides being set up in neighbourhoods for the kids. There are also many programmes broadcasted on TV, focusing specifically on the celebrations. Many people also choose to head out to malls, parks, or beaches to spend a fun-filled evening with the family.</big></font></p>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Hevetica'><big>Saudia Arabia=Saudi Arabia is the hub of Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations as Muslims from around the world travel to Makkah and Madinah for Umrah during Ramadan, and most choose to stay until Eid before returning home to their loved ones.  The locals, however, gather at the home of a family member and celebrate the festivities together over a meal after Eid prayers. Children also receive gifts from the elders in the family, in the form of money or gift bags containing toys and sweets.

Many Muslims also choose to donate to charities and offer gifts to the less privileged during the festival of Eid, often anonymously, so they, too, can celebrate the day with their families. The festive atmosphere is also seen on the streets where every Muslim greets others without discrimination.

In some parts of Saudi Arabia, people also decorate their homes with welcoming rugs outside their doors and share meals comprising traditional Arabic cuisine with their neighbours and other Muslims.</big></font></p>
