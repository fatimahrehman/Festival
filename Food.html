<h1><font color='black'><font face='Georgia'><u><i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i>What are some of the main traditional Eid food and where do they eat it?<u></font></h1>
<h1 id='a'><font color='black'><font face='Verdana'><u>Breakfast</u></font></h1>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'>Morocco=Morocco kicks the day off with a breakfast of laasida, a dish that looks similar to rice pudding but consists of couscous, butter, honey and seasoning. Simple, yet sweet (which may explain why Eid is so often known as Sweet Eid), laasida may start the day, but a traditional tagine often finishes it. Popular throughout all of North Africa at this time of year, tagines most commonly use chicken, although, for Eid, it’s not unusual to see mutton-meat tagines with dried fruits instead.</font></p>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'>Pakistan=For brunch, people often serve brunch-related snacks and meals such as dahi baras, samosas, chana chaat, nihari, and halwa poori. For dessert, kheer or sheer khurma is very popular.</font></p>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'>Indonesia=Influenced by the country’s history of Dutch colonisation, Indonesia often tucks into a particularly delicious sounding thousand layered spice cake to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Known as lapis legit, it is also a dish that remains popular in the Netherlands (albeit under the name of spekkoek) and is perhaps one of the most time-consuming Eid dishes; each layer is made from poured and broiled batter, before being assembled into the finished product.</font></p>

<h1 id='b'><font color='black'><font face='Verdana'><u>Lunch/Dinner</font></h1>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'>Malaysia=While Eid al-Fitr is actually known as Hari Raya in Malaysia, there are still plenty of traditional dishes associated with the celebration, the most notable of which is the spicy coconut curry known as rendang. While beef may not be popular for the UK biryani dish, it’s the main ingredient in Malaysia’s popular Eid dish, also enjoyed in Indonesia (the country from which it originated) and the rest of the Malay diaspora, which includes Singapore, Brunei, parts of the Philippines and, of course, Malaysia.</font></p>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'>UK=In the UK, one of the most popular Eid dishes is easily a classic biryani, which brings together meat and rice in a highly flavourful, heavily spiced dish. While chicken is typical, it’s not uncommon to see a whole spectrum of meats used for the Eid biryani, from mutton and lamb to goat, although fish is a lesser spotted protein of choice. Served with raita (cucumber, mint and yoghurt dip), salad and pickles on the side, it’s easy to see why this is a year-round favourite in the UK too.</font></p>
<p><font color='white'><font face='Helvetica'>Yemen=Sometimes known as aseed, as well as aseeda, this Yemeni jelly dessert, which doesn’t look dissimilar to a Mexican flan, is also enjoyed in Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Libya. Aseeda, made primarily from wheat and honey,is regularly savoured in and amongst the traditional Sudanese Eid festivities, which include paying house calls and accepting sweets from their neighbours, and is typically served boiling hot and eaten fast! Bint Alsahan is also popular in Yemen.</font></p>
